# Videometadatabase
A NodeJS based website using JSON files as the base. Also includes scripts to make compiled JSON files from files generated by [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html) / [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

[Website running the script](https://finnrepo.a2hosted.com/YTPMV_Database)

=========================

__jsonFolderReader__ - The script used for processing the individual metadata files generated by youtube-dl / yt-dlp. Strips unneeded values and compiles them.

__jsonMonthDivider__ - The script that further processes the metadata. Takes all the metadata files generated by _jsonFolderReader_ and recompiles them based on release months. Adds information provided by JSON files generated by _nicoTagExtractor_ and _youtubeUserLogger._ Also leaves out entries related to certain channels based on a JSON list of channel IDs (not currently present in this repository).

__jsonDownloadLister__ - The script that generates a list of downloaded metadata for youtube-dl / yt-dlp. Utilizes the metadata files generated by _jsonFolderReader._

__nicoTagExtractor__ - The script that gathers tags from Niconico videos. Utilizes the metadata files generated by either _jsonFolderReader_ or _jsonMonthDivider,_ the script scrolls through the entries and picks Niconico IDs among them.

__youtubeUserLogger__ - The script that bundles IDs shared by a same YouTube user together. Utilizes the metadata files generated by _jsonFolderReader_ and does not check the active web pages.

__YTPMVMetadataArchive__ - The script that is used to run the database. Utilizes the metadata files generated by _jsonMonthDivider._
